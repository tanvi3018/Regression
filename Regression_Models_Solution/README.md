Regression Models
Purpose

The Regression Models Solution project is designed to build and evaluate various regression models to predict a target variable based on input features. This project explores different regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and more, using a dataset that requires accurate prediction of continuous values. The goal is to identify the best-performing model by comparing their performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.
How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Regression_Models_Solution.git
cd Regression_Models_Solution

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or above). Then, install the required Python packages:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and located in the appropriate directory as expected by the code. Modify the data_loader.py script if necessary to adjust to your data structure.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to train and evaluate the regression models:

sh

    python regression_models_solution/main.py

    View Results:
    The script will output performance metrics for each regression model, and you can review these results to determine the best model for your dataset.

Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. Here are the key dependencies:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical computations.
    scikit-learn: For implementing various regression models and evaluation metrics.
    matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the results.
    seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.

To install these dependencies, use the command:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
